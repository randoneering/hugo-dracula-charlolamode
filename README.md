# charlola.mode (Dracula Themed!)

I loved this hugo theme so much that I needed to add my love of the Dracula Theme to it as well. All credit for the full structure of this Hugo Theme goes to [Charlotte Martin](https://github.com/charlola).  I used the color palette provided by the official dracula [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/contribute#color-palette),
